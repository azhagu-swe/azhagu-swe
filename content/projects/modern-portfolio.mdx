# Overview

This portfolio was built to showcase high-performance web development skills. It uses **Next.js 16** with the App Router and Turbopack for lightning-fast builds.

## Key Features

### 1. Theming System
Built with `next-themes`, it supports three distinct modes:
- **Paper**: A clean, minimalist light mode.
- **OLED**: A deep black dark mode for high-contrast screens.
- **Matrix**: A hacker-style green theme.

### 2. MDX Engine
Content is managed via MDX files, allowing for rich content authoring with React components embedded directly in markdown.

```tsx
// Example Component
<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

## Technical Challenges

One of the main challenges was integrating `next-pwa` with Next.js 16's Turbopack, which required careful configuration and fallback strategies.
