# Hello World

This is my first blog post. I'm using **Next.js** with **MDX**.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

```jsx
<div className="p-4 bg-muted text-foreground">
  This is a code block.
</div>
```
